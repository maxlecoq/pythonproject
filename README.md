Steps to do/ things to analyze:
- create new dataframe by creating the average for every country over the years (no develepment over time visible)
- compare differnet countries over time
- create dummys
- use groupby
- create new columns (e.g. life expectancy combined for men and women,...)
- do regressions
- do statistical tests
interaction terms the problem is that we don't have a lot of data mostly if we only take one country maybe can create a dummy for 2 diff period of time
